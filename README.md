# learnTS
Noob here learning ts, js sucks.

# Why should you learn from me/with me?
Too be frank, you shouldn't. 
Lol just kidding, yeah agreed I'm not that good at TS right now to teach anyone 
but you can definatley learn with me because it would be so much fun and we 
can help each other stay consistent.Join me if you're up for this.

# how to setup 
You can do it using npm or pnpm or yarn.

If you want to do it fancy way you can do it with vscode packages but I'm not free unlike you so I'll use pnpm.

I used pnpm becase obviously huh😮‍💨, Who uses slow boring npm now?
